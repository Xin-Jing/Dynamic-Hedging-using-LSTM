# Dynamic-Hedging-using-LSTM
When working as a research intern at Tsinghua University, I developed an LSTM neural network for dynamic hedging, which outperformed 5 baseline models in several markets. Please see [the description of this project](Dynamic_Hedging_using_LSTM.pdf)

The [code](Code.py) is implemented in Python with Tensorflow, and the [baselines](Baselines.Rmd) were implementedin R.

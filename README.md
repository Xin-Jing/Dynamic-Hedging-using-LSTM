# Dynamic-Hedging-using-LSTM
A new and more effective method for dynamic hedging, developed during my research internship at Tsinghua University.
The LSTM neural network outperformed 5 baseline models in several markets. Please see the [project presentation slides](Dynamic_Hedging_using_LSTM.pdf).

The [code](Code.py) is implemented in Python with Tensorflow, and the [baselines](Baselines.Rmd) were implemented in R.
